 * In the case of flex sensors, it is important to realize that the resistance of the flex 
 * sensor when straight and when bent can vary significantly from flex sensor to flex sensor.
 * Before building your flex sensor circuit, use a multimeter to measure the resistance of
 * your particular flex sensor when bent (bentR value) and when straight (straightR value).
 * 
 *  Refer to the Outcomes:Reverse Engineering a Flex Sensor document under the "Wiki" Tab
 *  for schmatic diagram
